## Description

This repo houses all code related to controlling the HoloLens 2 for the Spring 2023 MIT 2.120 Robotics Class Project: An Avatar Rescue Bot. Specifically, we aim to achieve three key tasks:

1. Real-Time Navigation and Data Visualization
2. Force and Pump Override Adjustment Capability
3. Live Feed Display and Audio from Operator to Care Site

## Installation

Please see the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jsBMaB0MUb40jxV13PPMbnD3ZUolpd2wvhG_WX-qII/edit) for a general overview of getting things working with the HoloLens 2.

You may also need some Python packages to run the scripts. It is recommended to create a new conda environment (download Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)), activate it, and then install the requirments.txt file:

```
conda create -n 2.120 python=3.9
conda activate 2.120
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

One simple test you can run is by navigating to the `Comms/Mock` folder and running the `mock_server.py` script on a server computer, and then running the `mock_hololens.py` script on a separate computer. Specifically, you may perform the following steps:

1. First obtain two laptops or computers to use, one to run the server code, and the other to run the mock client Python code.
2. On the client computer, edit the following line in `mock_hololens.py`:

```
# Replace the following with the IP address of the machine running the server
server_ip = "xx.xx.xx.xx"  # Define the server IP address (localhost in this case)
server_port = 21200  # Define the server port number
```

3. To find the server ip, open a terminal on the server computer and depending on your OS, run the following command:

```
# Windows
> ipconfig

# macOS / Linux
% ifconfig
```

4. Run the `mock_server.py` code on the server computer:

```
python mock_server.py
```

5. Run the `mock_hololens.py` on the client computer:

```
python mock_client.py
```
